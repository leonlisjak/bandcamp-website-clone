                <h4>Bandcamp Fair Trade Music Policy
                </h1>
                <p id="prvi-paragraf">Bandcamp believes that music is an indispensable part of culture, and for that culture to thrive, artists must be compensated fairly and transparently for their work.

                </p>
                <p id="drugi-paragraf">We’re proud of the fact that when you choose to pay an artist on Bandcamp, your money reaches them quickly, and in a way that is simple to explain and understand. Our business, which was founded in 2008 and has been profitable since 2012, is based on taking a revenue share of sales. Our share is 15% on digital items, and 10% on physical goods. Payment processor fees are separate and vary depending on the size of the transaction, but for an average size purchase, amount to an additional 4-7%. The remainder, usually 80-85%, goes directly to the artist, and we pay out daily.

                </p>
                <p id="treci-paragraf">Since we only make money when artists make a lot more money, our interests remain aligned with those of the community we serve. It’s a straightforward approach, and one we’re happy to say works well. <b>Fans have paid artists and independent labels $377 million using Bandcamp, and $8.3 million in the past 30 days alone.</b> Thank you for being a part of a fair, sustainable music economy!
