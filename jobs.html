        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 class="podnaslovprvi">How we work?</h2>
            <p>Our team is sprinkled throughout the world, with arms, cells, pods, what-have-yous in Oakland, Brooklyn, Montreal, British Columbia, the British Isles, Pittsburgh, Vermont, Paris, and Tokyo. We build our teams with care, attracting kind, smart, funny people who enjoy working together to help artists and fans worldwide. We use a bunch of online collaboration tools to work and entertain each other across time zones, and once a year we all get together in person for a week of trust falls and youthful misunderstandings (all ages welcome, no actual trust falls).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 class="podnaslovdrugi">What we offer?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Work from anywhere. You can work for Bandcamp from wherever you want to be, so long as the wifi is strong and your schedule overlaps with your team at least four hours each day. If you prefer a co-working space to your kitchen table we cover the cost, and you’re always welcome to work from one of our as-close-as-we-get-to-an-office offices in Oakland, Victoria, Brooklyn, and Raleigh.
                </li>
                <li>Generous vacation (as in, no set number of days). We’ll remind you to take some, if necessary.
                </li>
                <li>Family leave. We have common sense leave, so take what you need. If you’ve been at Bandcamp for a year, your leave is fully paid.
                </li>
                <li>Matched charitable donations.
                </li>
                <li>Health, vision, dental, 401k matching, and travel insurance, but these are country-specific, so let’s talk.
                </li>
            </ul>

                </li>
                <li>Inspirationally clear communication and reasoning, especially when things get “exciting.”
                </li>
                <li>An in-depth knowledge of current abuse vectors and counter-strategies.
                </li>
